			     Console Jabber Client
		   (c) 2003 Jacek Konieczny <jajcus@bnet.pl>

CJC is a Jabber/XMPP client for text terminals. It uses pyxmpp library for XMPP
comunication and curses for screen output. It is not finished yet, but still
quite usable. Its user interface is resembling those of popular IRC clients
like irssi or BitchX.

Requirements:
-------------

1. Python interpreter

	PyXMPP and CJC were tested with Python 2.2.3, but probably it will also
	work with some older Python versions.

2. PyXMPP - http://jabberstudio.org/projects/pyxmpp

	If you are using CJC from CVS then probably the best choice is to use
	latest PyXMPP from CVS too. For official releases the latest PyXMPP
	release before that CJC release should work well (but newer release may
	work better).

3. libxml2 python bindings - http://xmlsoft.org/

	This is rather pyxmpp requirement and the libxml2 module should match
	libxml2 library version used to compile PyXMPP. CJC was tested with
	libxml2-2.5.8 and libxml2-2.5.9.

When Psyco (a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler) is available it will be used
to improve CJC speed.


Usage:
------

See the attached manual (doc/manual.html). Some day it may be complete :-)


Bug reports and feature requests:
---------------------------------

The best place to send those is the CJC page on JabberStudio:

	http://jabberstudio.org/projects/cjc

But you can write to me directly via e-mail: jajcus@bnet.pl 
or jabber: jajcus@jabber.bnet.pl

But if you don't describe your problem or wish on JabberStudio I may forget
about it.
